> **The 1-Line Runtime Circuit Breaker — and the SP/1.0 Conformance Standard — for Autonomous AI Agents.**
> Stop runaway token loops, unhandled tool cascades, and accidental $4,000 API bills before they happen — and prove your runtime enforces the mediation contract with verifiable conformance fixtures.

## 🔒 SP/1.0 — The Conformance Standard

SHACKLE is not only a runtime circuit breaker — it is the **authored, verifiable conformance standard** for runtime mediation of agent tool calls.

- **Decision surface:** `ALLOW` / `DENY` / `HITL`
- **Conformance model:** `Valid(τ) ⇔ Required(τ) ⊆ Supported(τ)`
- **14 hash-verifiable conformance vectors** in [`fixtures/conformance.json`](fixtures/conformance.json) — 9 decision-core + 5 HITL transition cases (approve / reject / modify / defer-escalate / duplicate-resume)
- **Pure reference implementation:** [`shackle/conformance.py`](shackle/conformance.py) — a stdlib-only `decide(config, state, call) -> (verdict, reason)`
- **Executable proof:** `pytest tests/test_conformance.py` runs every vector against the reference
- **Core invariant:** *history-visible ≠ runtime-executable* — a record that an action happened is not proof the transition was supported

A runtime is **SHACKLE-conformant** iff it passes the published fixture set — provable by **reproduction, not assertion**. See **[CONFORMANCE.md](CONFORMANCE.md)** for the full specification and how to claim conformance. The fixture hashes have been independently reproduced by third parties.

**Authorship & provenance:** SHACKLE, the `Required ⊆ Supported` conformance model, the `decide()` surface, and the HITL transition contract are authored by **Dante Bullock ([@Fame510](https://github.com/Fame510))**, sole author. First published 2026-06-17.

## Provenance

SHACKLE was built by **Dante Bullock**, a 52-year-old self-taught systems architect and
engineer out of Oakland, California. No venture capital. No corporate incubator.
Just raw necessity and a refusal to watch autonomous agents burn money in
silent infinite loops.

Rather than guessing what the agent ecosystem needed, Sovereign Logic used
real-time web scraping and community sentiment mining to audit the issue
trackers of CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph Ã¢ÂÂ mapping the exact systemic
failures affecting developers in production, then building the drop-in
circuit breaker to fix them.

This is infrastructure built by a developer, for developers Ã¢ÂÂ sovereign,
lean, and zero-bloat.

## Ã°ÂÂÂ¯ When to Use SHACKLE

**SHACKLE is purpose-built for:**
- **Local development and debugging** Ã¢ÂÂ Interactive HITL console gives you real-time control
- **CLI agents and supervised workflows** Ã¢ÂÂ Resume/Skip/Abort when loops are detected
- **Cross-framework coverage** Ã¢ÂÂ One decorator works across CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen
- **Budget enforcement** Ã¢ÂÂ Client-side token tracking prevents runaway costs
- **Iterative testing** Ã¢ÂÂ Catch loops early in the development cycle

**For headless production APIs** (serverless functions, FastAPI endpoints, background workers where blocking for human input isn't an option), consider framework-native solutions like [TokenCircuit](https://github.com/) for automated LangGraph overrides.

SHACKLE and production-oriented tools solve complementary problems: use SHACKLE during development and testing, then transition to automated overrides for deployed APIs if needed.

---

## Ã¢ÂÂ¡ The Problem

AI agents are highly capable, but their error-handling is fundamentally broken. When an agent hits an unhandled tool error (401 Unauthorized, changed API payload, dead endpoint), it rarely self-corrects. Instead, it enters a **"Loop of Death"** Ã¢ÂÂ retrying the exact same tool with the exact same input, burning your context window and running up massive API bills in minutes.

Frameworks like **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, and **LangGraph** lack native, framework-agnostic spending guardrails or deterministic loop breakers.

## Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã¯Â¸Â The Solution

SHACKLE is a lightweight, zero-dependency governance layer that sits inside your runtime via dynamic Python shims. It intercepts **LLM calls** and **tool executions** client-side, monitoring execution state deterministically.

When an agent breaches your boundaries, SHACKLE trips the circuit breaker, halts execution, and drops you into an interactive terminal console.

### Key Features

- **1-Line Install** Ã¢ÂÂ no refactoring your agent topology
- **Loop of Death Prevention** Ã¢ÂÂ detects identical sequential tool calls and error cascades
- **Budget Enforcement** Ã¢ÂÂ real-time token tracking against a client-side pricing table
- **Execution Timeouts** Ã¢ÂÂ prevents hung threads on dead APIs
- **HITL Console** Ã¢ÂÂ interactive terminal with Resume / Skip / Abort options
- **100% Client-Side** Ã¢ÂÂ no telemetry, no phone-home, no hidden SaaS

---

## Ã°ÂÂÂ Quick Start

### 1. Install

> **Note:** the PyPI release is being published. Until `pip install shackle`
> is live, install directly from source (works today):

```bash
# From source (available now)
git clone https://github.com/Fame510/SHACKLE.git
cd SHACKLE
pip install -e .

# Or, once published to PyPI:
pip install shackle
```

### 2. Guard Your Workflow

```python
from shackle import Guard
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Your normal CrewAI setup
my_crew = Crew(agents=[...], tasks=[...])

# One line to add circuit breaking
@Guard(budget=0.25, max_repeat_calls=3, timeout_seconds=180)
def run():
    return my_crew.kickoff()

run()
```

That's it. SHACKLE dynamically hooks the underlying interpreters Ã¢ÂÂ no CrewAI source changes needed.

## Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¸Â The Four Circuit Breakers

| Trigger | Condition | Default | What Happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| **REPETITIVE_TOOL_CALL** | Same tool + same input called N times, or input contains error signals | 3 attempts | Drops to HITL console |
| **BUDGET_EXCEEDED** | Accumulated token cost exceeds limit (via local pricing table) | $0.20 | Hard execution freeze |
| **TIMEOUT_REACHED** | Wall-clock execution exceeds threshold | 180 seconds | Immediate halt |
| **MAX_TOOL_CALLS** | Total tool invocations exceed limit | 50 calls | Hard stop |

### Error Loop Amplification

SHACKLE **amplifies sensitivity** when tool inputs contain error signals (`401`, `500`, `timeout`, `unauthorized`, etc.) Ã¢ÂÂ catching the "I'll just try again" loop before the agent burns tokens on a permission error it can't fix.

---

## Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã¯Â¸Â The HITL Console

When a breaker trips, SHACKLE renders an interactive terminal:

```
Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¸Â SHACKLE CIRCUIT BREAKER: REPETITIVE_TOOL_CALL

Agent:         ResearchAgent
Tool:          web_search
Input:         {"query": "latest AI news", "error": "401 Unauthorized"}
Call Count:    3x
Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Session Stats Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ
Tokens:        In: 8,400 | Out: 1,200
Session Cost:  $0.02850
Time Running:  47.2s

Options:
  [R] Resume/Reset Ã¢ÂÂ clear history, continue execution
  [S] Skip Ã¢ÂÂ return dummy output, attempt context flush
  [A] Abort Ã¢ÂÂ hard terminate the current run

Select action (R/S/A):
```

## Ã°ÂÂÂ° Commercial Licensing

SHACKLE is open-source under **AGPLv3** Ã¢ÂÂ free for individual developers,
hobbyists, and open-source projects. If you're using SHACKLE in a closed-source
commercial product, SaaS platform, or enterprise deployment, the AGPLv3
requires you to open-source your entire application. Most companies don't
want to do that Ã¢ÂÂ so they purchase a commercial license instead.

### What a Commercial License Gets You

| | AGPLv3 (Free) | Commercial License |
|---|---|---|
| Use in closed-source products | Ã¢ÂÂ | Ã¢ÂÂ |
| White-label / rebrand | Ã¢ÂÂ | Ã¢ÂÂ |
| No copyleft obligations | Ã¢ÂÂ | Ã¢ÂÂ |
| Priority support | Community | SLA-backed |
| Custom integration assistance | Self-serve | Architecture audit |

### Licensing Options

Commercial licensing is available for:
- **Developer / Startup teams** shipping closed-source agent products
- **Enterprise deployments** requiring on-prem, SOC2 compliance, or SLA support
- **Framework companies** (CrewAI, LangGraph, etc.) wanting white-label integration

Pricing is customized based on your needs, team size, and deployment scale.
